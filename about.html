I am a [MD-PhD student](http://www.md.utoronto.ca/current-student-biographies) at [The University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/). I started the program in 2013 and after 1 year of the MD program, in 2014, began my PhD with [Dr. Paul Frankland](http://www.franklandlab.com/) at [The Hospital for Sick Children](http://www.sickkids.ca/). 

Before starting on the 8 year journey to become a clinician scientist I was a masters student under [Dr. Jason Lerch](http://medbio.utoronto.ca/faculty/lerch.html) at the Mouse Imaging Centre - elaborated on [here]({% post_url 2014-07-29-msc %}). Before that I was an undergraduate student at [McMaster University](http://www.mcmaster.ca/) - I outlined the program [here]({% post_url 2014-07-28-bsc %}).

I am interested in many aspects of medicine, neuroscience, computer science, open science (and open government) and writing. I will use this website to write about these and share what I learn throughout my studies.
